About The Game
Hangman is a single or multiplayer game where a player are presented with a letter that must be guessed, a player gets a specified number of attempts to get the word right.

To Run The Game
To run the project you must have visual studios 2022 installed on your computer device, first you will unzip the archive you will see the user documentation and a folder named ‘Game’ save the folder to this directory ‘C:\Users\User\source\repos’ note that that will depend on the user name on your computer. Once you have done that you will then open the file that has the extension of ‘.sln’ that is the solution file where you will be able to debug the project. Once you have done that you will see the form design and the code on the development . Press the start button to begin the debugging and the game play will be enable.

The Game Play
Now lets get to the game play, you will be presented with a label showing the name on the game and two buttons namely ‘Start’ and ‘Quit’ press the Start button to start the game or the Quit button to close the form. If you try to press a key before you start the game you will be presented with an error message. Once you have pressed the Start button you will be presented with a label displaying the length of the word in asterisks, a list box that will display all the wrong attempts you have made during the game play, another list box that will display the word you guessed right and your score at the end of the game, a label that will display the number of attempts you have left which will start at 10 and decrement by 1 as you guess the wrong letters. As you guess the letters in your given word right, the asterisks will change to the letters you guessed right and then if you guess them all right before the attempts left reaches 0 then you will win the game and a message will be displayed telling you that you won, if the attempts left reaches 0 before you guess all the letters right you will loose the game and a message telling you that the game is over will be displayed. You can press the ‘New Game’ button anytime during the game play and you will be presented with a new word to guess.

Good Luck!
